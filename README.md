> ServiceWorker generation plugin for Hapi.js

hapi-sw is a Hapi.js plugin that creates a Service Worker with [sw-precache][sw-precache].

## Motivation

Service Workers are a building block for progressive web apps, but require intricate configuration. There are already great projects like [sw-toolbox][sw-toolbox] and the aforementioned [sw-precache][sw-precache] that can help you generate Service Worker code effectively, but typically require some cross-cutting information that might not be readily available at build-time. Additionally, these tools make assumptions that favor static assets while ignoring the server-side routes which ultimately deliver those assets.

This plugin addresses that problem by using generating a properly configured Service Worker dynamically, based on the assets and routes available to your server.

## Usage

Add hapi-sw as a dependency to your Hapi.js project:

```
npm install hapi-sw --save
```

Register the plugin with a *connected* Hapi server, passing your configuration for sw-precache as options for the plugin/

```javascript
const Hapi = require('hapi')
const server = new Hapi.Server()

server.connection({ port: 3000 })

server.register({
  register: require('hapi-sw'),
  options: {
    staticFileGlobs: [
        `assets/**.{css,js}`,
        `assets/img/**.*`
    ],
    runtimeCaching: [
          {
              urlPattern: new RegExp(CDN_DOMAIN),
              handler: 'cacheFirst'
          }
      ]
  }
}, (err) => {
  // service worker now available at /service-worker.js
})
```

See the [example code](./blob/master/example/index.js) to get a more detailed understanding of what a typical setup might look like. Here's how to run it locally:

```bash
$ npm install
$ cd example
$ node index.js
```

## When you register this plugin, a few things happen:

* Routes for the Service Worker and it's registration code are added
  * `/service-worker.js` is source of the worker generated by [sw-precache][sw-precache]
    * This file is generated dynamically whenever the server starts
    * TODO: in the future there should be an option to write to a file
  * `/service-worker-registration.js` is the example registration file, recommended by the sw-precache

* A listener is added to the 'route' event
  * Whenever any subsequent routes are added to the server, hapi-sw will inspect them for any custom plugin settings
  * This allows for route-scoped rules to be added to the options sent to sw-precache
    * For instance, you could add a rule on a route to add that url to the pre-fetched cached:

```javascript
server.route({
  path: '/',
  config: {
    plugins: {
      sw: {
          dynamicUrlToDependencies: [
            './templates/homepage.html',
            './templates/layout.html'
          ]
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Configuration

All top-level settings given at registration are passed through sw-precache. See the [sw-precache Options Parameter documentation](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#table-of-contents) for the full list of options and what they do.

### Route Configuration

The following options may be set in a route's `sw` plugin config:

* `dynamicUrlToDependencies`
* `dontCacheBustUrlsMatching`
* `navigateFallback`
* `runtimeCaching`

Any rules passed to these settings will be scoped to the route's path unless otherwise specified.
